# MSEA v175.2 Scripts

-----

## When posting/updating scripts:
- scripts must be placed in the correct version folder/sub-folder
- all script names must be the same as previously posted in past versions
- all changable value in scripts must be changed to "%arg" followed by a number, such as "%arg1"
- tags must be added to the script if needed (**//not working** for not working scripts, **//auto bans** for autobannable scripts, and **//override** to load the script into the trainer regardless if it works or not)
